# Penumbra
A music manager mod for balatro allowing for individual tracks to be enabled and disabled

For an example of json song loading check out example.json, which must be placed in penumbra/assets/sounds and the path in the json is relative to that path

For crossmod you can add to Penumbra.loc_keys, with the key being your musics key and the value being a localisation key representing the songs name
for example Penumbra.loc_keys["entr_music_entropic"\] = "k_entropic_music"
